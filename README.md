# Dark Souls II Stats Calculator

This is just a simple starter project as an introduction to programming in Python.  

## Getting Started Instructions

1. Open up PyCharm and open the stats-calculator project.  It should be in your home director 
under ~/Workspace/stats-calculator. 
2. Open up the ``statcalc.py`` file.  
3. From the terminal, run the file using the ``python3 statcalc.py`` command.  

The output of the command should show you the HP given the attributes in the file.  However, the file does not include
all of the attributes.  

## Today's Assignment

1. Try putting in a stat that is greater than 99 or less than 0.  What happens? 
2. Change the vigor stat (make sure to save), run the program and see what happens. Do the
same thing for another attribute.  Did the HP change when you changed vigor? What about when you changed
the other attribute? 
3.  Implement the rest of the ``calculate_other_hp`` function. It should look a lot like the 
``calculate_vig_hp`` function. 
4.  Add the rest of the attributes to the attribute dictionary.  
5.  How would we go about calculating other stats?
